Build a full-stack Hardware-as-a-Service (HaaS) proof-of-concept web app.

The app should allow users to:

Sign up and log in securely with encrypted credentials.

Create and access projects, each with a project name, ID, and description.

View available hardware resources (e.g., HWSet1 and HWSet2) showing capacity and availability.

Check out and check in hardware units, updating the database accordingly.

Display total hardware capacity as a global shared quantity across all projects.

Technical details:

Frontend: React + TypeScript

Backend: Python (FastAPI or Flask)

Database: MongoDB (stores user, project, and hardware info)

Security: Encrypt passwords before saving; API endpoints should use authentication.

Deployment: Host on cloud (Heroku or Render) with accessible URL.

Testing: Include simple PyTest unit tests for API endpoints.

The goal is to meet stakeholder needs SN1â€“SN6 from a typical HaaS system (secure accounts, project management, resource tracking, scalability). Provide clear file structure, comments, and example data.
